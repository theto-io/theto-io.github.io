			<title>Upcoming hard-fork</title>
			<description>
				<p>A series of changes to be rolled out in a single hard-fork:</p>
				<p>(1) Refund order creation fees when the order is cancelled</p>
				<p>(2) Fix Referral Program cash-back bug</p>
				<p>(3) Fix margin call price so that is not called unless the feed is below/above the call price (this should prevent a lot of margin calls from occurring)</p>
				<p>(4) Liquidity maker/taker differentiation for the purpose of allocating trading fees to stimulate liquidity - in the form of a new flag on assets (both SmartCoins &amp; UIA) that the issuers will be able to control</p>

			<title>Forced settlement issue is re-enabled</title>
			<description>The main reason of the controversy, i.e. inaccurate price feeds for CNY, has been successfully addressed by upgrading the price feed script. Committee members have created a proposal that re-enables the forced settlement feature and it has become effective after most committee members supported it.</description>

			<title>Forced settlement issue</title>
			<description>The recent release of GUI wallet introduces a 'Force Settlement' button. Some people say that this function allows users to exploit a "loophole" in the bitCNY market and "gain profit at the expense of the bitCNY providers". Others (including BM) say those changes have been discussed in the past and there are tradeoffs that must be made, so there is nothing "new", "unexpected" or "flawed" in how the market is behaving.</description>

			<title>Fee Backed Assets</title>
			<description>This new kind of digital asset trades like any of the others but has fascinating new properties. There could be a new asset for every new revenue generating feature in the whole ecosystem. Developers recoup their costs by selling (or pre-selling) these revenue generating software devices (or keeping them to earn the revenue they produce).</description>

			<title>Plasma? The holy grail of the crypto DEX?</title>
			<description>BM hinted at a new project called plasma in a mumble session which would allow interoperability between chains. With plasma, the user can deposit btc backed by actual on-chain btc instead of btc collateralized by bts, eliminating the worry about margin maintenance and liquidity.  This would allow a much more seamless user trading experience, at least among various blockchain assets.  In other words, users would be able to trade pairs such as btc/eth while knowing that the assets are completely accounted for on the native chains.</description>

			<title>IOTA + Bitshares</title>
			<description>IOTA is a lightweight, blockless micro-transactions token aimed specifically at Internet-of-Things (IoT). It seems that Bitshares is not aiming for micro-transactions and instead focusing on its strengths. One of IOTA's goals is to find overlap and collaborate with the serious blockchain projects as we see no reason to 'compete', instead we rather compliment the blockchain projects.</description>
